## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
It's been a great experience using Tailwind to build projects, it blows Vanila CSS out the window!
One key element I love about using Tailwind to build is how I can easily create responsive components without writing long media queries for them, I can basically use the specific breakpoint utility class and bam!
